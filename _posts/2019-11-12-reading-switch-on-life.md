Recently, a friend shared her thoughts on this book. I had it already, but for whatever reason, never got around to reading it. 

I’m three chapters in and, wow, what a treasure! And what timing! An answer to a lot of prayers for wisdom and further healing. Seems a lot of my research and experiences of late (ugh) were preparing me for this. Isn’t God kind to let us ”wander” under our own power and ”smarts” until we realize that God’s Loving hand was there all along—ready to catch us, heal us, restore us.

This book is reminding me (renewing my mind) that God can restore what was lost and stolen. You are not your brain, or your genes. Science is proving God right, once again. Now if certain scientists would only stop wandering under the power of their own ”smarts.”  

A few quotes from the Switch On Your Brain that have struck me:

“Epigenetics research demonstrates that our lifestyles and environment can transform the way our genes are expressed, and evidence from this field shows us we are not being controlled by the structure of our brains.“

“You have the power in your mind to change the negative, toxic manifestations. Our minds shape the world. This is what neuroplasticity is all about: change. Neuroplasticity is God’s design for renewing the mind.”

“We are not victims of our biology or circumstances. How we react to the events and circumstances of life can have an enormous impact on our mental and even physical health.”

Some Scripture passages that I’m looking at with greater understanding:

“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” Romans 12:2

“Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things” Philippians 4:8

Switch on life. 
It’s your choice.
