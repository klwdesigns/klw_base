I would've liked to have had the opportunity to speak with Simone de Beauvoir. I wouldn't have asked her many questions. The first being:

Did you ever stop to consider that your Roman Catholic upbringing might have negatively influenced your view of Jesus Christ?

And the second question, I would ask (depending on her answer):

Have you ever made a serious study of the books of the Bible, examining the original languages, the historical contexts in which the books were written, including the history of the Jews and first century Greco-Roman culture and religions?

(I can't find anywhere that she ever made a serious study of the books of the Bible in part or as a cohesive, unfolding story of redemption.)

I would begin with these two questions because I find again and again in Beauvoir's writings (and those who hold similar views) the incorrect association/beliefs:

Roman Catholicism = Christianity

The third question I might ask:

How was being "Sartre's woman" any more liberating, philosophically, physically, emotionally or otherwise, than being a follower of a religion that sees woman as second to man?

Seems to me like Beauvoir's view of man 

\*\*A negative filter has been added to the photo of my copy of _The Second Sex_ by Simone de Beauvoir for all the above reasons.
