Given the opportunity, I would have asked Simone de Beauvoir many questions. The first being:

Did you ever stop to consider that your Roman Catholic upbringing might have negatively influenced your view of the books of the Bible, particularly Genesis?

The second question (depending on her answer to the first):

Have you ever made a serious study of the books of the Bible, examining the original languages, the historical contexts in which the books were written, including the history of the Jews and first century Greco-Roman culture and religions?

(I can't find anywhere that she ever made a serious study of the books of the Bible in part or as a cohesive, unfolding story of redemption.)

I would begin with these two questions because I find again and again in Beauvoir's writings (and those who hold similar views) the incorrect association/beliefs:

Roman Catholicism = Christianity

And the third question (depending on how the conversation was going):

How was being "Sartre's woman" (and Algren's) any more liberating, philosophically, physically, emotionally or otherwise, than being a follower of a religion that sees woman as second to man?

From a distance, seems to me like Beauvoir's view of life wasn't so beau nor was it sans parti pris. But I can't blame her. We all are influenced by experiences in childhood, for good or for bad. And those influences, many times, come out in ways that we don't even realize, even the most intellectual of us.

\*\*A negative filter has been added to the photo of my copy of _The Second Sex_ by Simone de Beauvoir to emphasize my point and to accentuate the blurred effect on the word second. No offense to the designer, of course.
