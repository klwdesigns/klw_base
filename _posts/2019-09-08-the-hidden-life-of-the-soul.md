This plaque has hung in my room for over twenty-five years. It was given to me as a birthday gift from a dear friend while we were at university. It was only recently (maybe a year or two ago?) that I took note of the author: Jean Nicholas Grou.

A French Jesuit priest, I read.
Unbelievable, I thought.
But perhaps I should have just said, “Mais oui.”

The friend who had the quotation framed is not Catholic. Far far from it! I’m not either. (We were attending a baptist university at the time of the gift.) Furthermore, she had no great interest in France or the Jesuits. And neither did I.

To see the quotation now, hanging on my wall, it might seem as though it were some kind of note of encouragement from a friend who was privy to my plans or desires to achieve some future, if not impossible, goal.

In 1991/2, none of my plans, none of my imaginations, included France. And it certainly didn’t include tennis.

The quotation hangs by the door. I see it every time I walk out of my room where I have prayed so many prayers. It’s a reminder that we are/I am God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance so that we may do them.

Destiny? Not sure that’s the word. But you get the meaning. 

There are more good works out there. Keep going. Keep crying out to God in every moment. You’ll make it.

“He never fails to grant such light as makes it impossible for us to lose our way so long as we follow His leading.”

\*\*Tennis was (past tense) a framework. Not the essense.
