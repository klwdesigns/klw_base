It’ll be 11 years in just a few weeks, and I still have to be reminded, “Don’t be afraid.”

Don’t you be either. God has this. God has you.

Just don’t ask me what it’s going to look like. Or how it’s going to end. I have no idea. Never have. God just kept giving me the faith to know that (surely) He would do it.

These pages are from one of my precious little black books. I was prompted to reach for it today and read. 

“Don’t be afraid.”

“Don’t you yet understand?”

“Through God we shall do valianty.”

“He will cover you with His pinions.”

And then the names and numbers between the verses. 

I had no idea how true it all would become. And I’m sure there’s more. Much more. A few of those prophecies are yet to be.

I’m still asking, “Why me, God?”

This is crazy! Or, at least, it just seems that way to the human eye.

“We walk by faith. Not by sight.”
