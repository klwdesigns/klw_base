“I saw the crosses so often—and often in unexpected places—like a thin dark veil of the Catholic Church spread over the New Mexico landscape,” said Georgia O’Keeffe.

I didn’t fully grasp O’Keeffe’s meaning at first. I was not in New Mexico. I was at home in Texas, seated at my desk with a roof over my head and a fresh demitasse of espresso in my hand.

Yesterday, while walking the ruins of the Franciscan mission in the Jemez Pueblo, I understood what O’Keeffe was saying. Under the bright New Mexico sun, I saw the dark veil. It was spread over the broken ground and hung from the crumbling walls of the nave and sacristy. And I think I saw something of its shadow in the faces of the Gisewa Indians who work at the historic site.  

O’Keeffe’s paintings of the black crosses of Taos have a spirituality about them that can be difficult to articulate. Much of her work is that way. Like beauty itself, her paintings are more idea and concept than a rendering of physical details.

As in O’Keeffe’s paintings of the black crosses, Jesus Christ was not to be found in the clay of the Jemez

Today, while walking the ruins of the Jemez pueblo in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, I understood O’Keeffe. I not only saw the dark veil in piles of crumbling clay bricks, I felt the dark veil, and I think I saw its shadows in the faces of the Indians who still live in Jemez and run the Jemez National Historic Site.

The Roman Catholic belief system was forced upon the Indians of Jemez by the Spanish explorers and colonists of the 17th century. Dubbing all that they saw “New Spain,” the Spanish believed it was their duty to punish, even kill, any Indian who would not convert to Roman Catholicism or contribute to its establishment in the region. There was not only no separation of church and state. There was no true understanding of Jesus Christ.

Standing in the center of the church in ruins, under the bright New Mexico sun, it seemed as if the darkness that the Spanish had brought had dissipated. But then I looked across the street. There was a new Roman Catholic church. Its walls were not made of clay bricks molded by the hands of Indian women. It was made of cement and had a bright white paint job.

It looked like a lot of baptist, Presbyterian and Methodist churches in America. I wondered how long it would take until it was in ruins too, and someone like me stood on its rumble, looking up at the sun, muttering to herself, “How did 

But the problem that had existed since Constantine (and before) was still there: Church hierarchy.

I’m not sure if this was the dark veil that O’Keeffe alluded to.
