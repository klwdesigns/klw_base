Georgia O’Keeffe described the black crosses that she so often encountered around Taos as “a thin dark veil of the Catholic Church spread over the New Mexico landscape.”

When I first read this statement by O’Keeffe, I didn’t fully grasp her meaning. Her paintings of the black crosses, particularly the one featured on the [Art Institute of Chicago’s website](https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46327/black-cross-new-mexico), was to arresting for me. Almost all of O’Keeffe’s work leaves me wanting for words to structure my emotions into something that can be understood, handled, even managed. 

Today, while walking the ruins of the Jemez pueblo in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, I understood O’Keeffe. I not only saw the dark veil in piles of crumbling clay bricks, I felt the dark veil, and I think I saw its shadows in the faces of the Indians who still live in Jemez and run the national historic site.

When the Spanish colonists and explorers made their way into what they called “New Spain”, they brought with them their priests and friars. The friars left in the Jemez Valley forced the Indians (mostly the women because they were the architects and the builders of the people in that region) to build a Roman Catholic church. Conversion was not an option in 17th Century Spain, why would it be in “New Spain”?

There are still many Roman Catholic churches and retreats centers in New Mexico. The Jemez Valley is also said to be the place where the Roman Catholic leadership in America has hidden a group of priests accused paedophilia.
