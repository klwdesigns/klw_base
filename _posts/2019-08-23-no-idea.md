Sometimes it’s good to admit that you have no idea what is going on. Actually, this is probably the most honest state to be in as a human being. 

Clueless.

Hi, my name is Clueless. And you? Your name is Clueless, too? Oh, great. We have something in common. Now, let’s get on with being friends.

Okay, not a Hollywood start, but honest. 

We could all use a lot more honesty in this world. We all might get along better, and real communication might actually happen.

Brilliant? 

Surely.
