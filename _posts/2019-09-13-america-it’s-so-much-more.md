European friends often ask me to describe a typical American meal. Much to their surprise I tell them that there isn’t a typical American meal. It depends on where you live in the country. America is a country of immigrants.

I was reminded of this unique aspect of my country yesterday, while in the New Orleans area for an unexpected and necessary trip. I had the privilege of hearing story upon story of hog hunting, the best seasonings for crawfish, boudin balls, etouffee, and poutine, and the history of the expulsion of the Acadians—-all told to me in thick Cajun accents.

As fascinating as NYC might be for a week, there’s so much more beyond the cement and skyscrapers. America is a thousand or more countries—-transplanted, diverse, beautiful, vast, mixed and still growing. 

Cafe du Monde? Maybe. 

But without a doubt, this is the land of lache pas la patate.
