As referenced in the previous note, Dude Perfect videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3GnbhbVCc). Texas natives, all of them, "perfect" is not hyperbole. These dudes are the masters of trick shots.

I found their ["Ping Pong Trick Shots 5"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t3GnbhbVCc) from two weeks ago quite apropos.

\*\*Not all who could've turned pro, go pro. Some end up on YouTube. Some sit at a desk all day long.
