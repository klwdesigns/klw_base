If your into Zen Buddhism or are well-read on Eastern religions, then you'll probably be able to finish the title. If not, well, here's the full proverb:

"If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him."

Its meaning can have broad application, far beyond Buddhism. Don't let yourself fall under the spell of anyone, especially not someone who seems to have achieved total enlightenment.

Jesus said something similar to the religious leaders (Pharisees) of Israel: "But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you shall be your servant."

I don't think the rise of eastern religions in western society is purely the result of greater awareness about other cultures. Like any religion, I think people are trying to satisfy some felt (or real) need in their psychological well-being.

All of these women, after separating from the family and removing themselves from the abuse, fell under the spell of another abuser. This has happened multiple times for all the women. The pattern is not new and is well-documented among childhood victims of abuse. But why I mention these women here is that all the women's abusers (post-father) were supposed spiritual leaders.

One of the leaders was a Hindu/New Age guru. Another was a Buddhist. Still yet another was a cult leader who masquerades as a pastor of a large church.

I think there is nothing new under the sun. That people will look for hope where they think they can find it and that wounded people will go on falling prey to people who abuse until they
