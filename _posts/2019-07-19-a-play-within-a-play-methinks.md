"The lady doth protest too much, methinks."

From the Second Quartro edition of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_, Act III, Scene II, spoken by Queen Gertrude in response to Prince Hamlet's probing question:

"Madam, how like you this play?"

For the full context, read the full scene [here](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/hamlet/hamlet.3.2.html). Or, for Mel Gibson's performance of the later part of scene II, watch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOGjVUa_iIE). 

Better yet, just watch the whole play, and wonder at the play-within-a-play. Methinks it's just a play without day.
