Pulling ten hour plus days writing a novel is more than a test in poetic acuity; it’s mental self-torture! And it’s really terrible for the lower back/hips, no matter how strong your core is. 

I was walking like this old rancher <https://youtu.be/DCmR9981v9E> for a few days before I found this exercise guru. He’s the Dude Perfect of sports physios, and I'm not sure he even knows it. (Forget the dumbell exercises and post more instant fixes, Mister!)

Check out his technique for self-therapy/strengthening for the lower back: <https://youtu.be/DWmGArQBtFI> 

You’ll be dancing like Dale Brisby in no time!
