Pulling ten hour plus days writing a novel is more than a test in mental stability; it’s an endurance sport! And it’s really terrible for the lower back/hips, no matter how strong your core is. 

I was walking like this old rancher [https://youtu.be/DCmR9981v9E](https://youtu.be/DCmR9981v9E)for a few days before I found the FIX THIS guy. He’s the “dude perfect” of sports physios.

Check out his technique for self-therapy/strengthening for the lower back: [https://youtu.be/DWmGArQBtFI](https://youtu.be/DWmGArQBtFI) 

You’ll be dancing like Dale Brisby in a rodeo in no time.
