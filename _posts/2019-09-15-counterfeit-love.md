Currency inspectors are trained in identifying counterfeits mainly by knowing every detail of the real thing, not by studying counterfeits. In short, when you know the real thing, counterfeits become obvious.

In matters of love, the same is true. When you've never known real love, you have no ability to identify true love. You're always draw to that which is counterfeit, that which never truly satisfies. Life can be quite painful.

That is, unless you allow yourself to question why you're attracted to counterfeits. Most people, I've encounter who are stuck loving counterfeits, sadly, don't have the ego strength to honestly evaluate. It seems scary. And some I've known feel as if they're going to die if they even begin the process of questioning.

To me, this doesn't seem very honest. It seems like a terrible state to exist in. But I tend to agree with Socrates in this: "The unexamined life is not worth living."

And by extension, I'd say that unexamined feelings or attractions are worth having.

What's prompted this note? Well, a long conversation last night with a few younger women. They weren't sure how to speak into the lives of several friends who have adopted homosexual or lesbian identities. Their friends had expressed emotional pain from trauma (within their family of origin), from current romantic relationships, from ongoing depression and other psychological events. 

It's not easy to speak into anyone's life, I conveyed quickly. Apart from a miracle, there is no way to instantly heal psychological trauma suffered in childhood. I cautioned them to pray for their friends, to listen to them friends and to offer, demonstrate, and show real love. By God's grace, that which is counterfeit will lose its shine, and their friends might start to feel safe, and might even begin to question what's real, and what's counterfeit.

For further insight and understanding, here is an excerpt from [an article by Dr. Joseph and Linda Nicolosi on lesbianism, for the German Institute for Youth and Society](https://www.dijg.de/english/tomboys-lesbians-relationship-accepting-sex-gender/): 

Therapist (and ex-Iesbian) Diane Eller-Boyko explains this unfulfilled longing, which she calls her "own personal story":

“A client will ... tell me - in words more or less Iike this - ‘Connecting with another woman felt Iike an ancient Ionging fulfilled. A homecoming’.  When I hear this, I know that something of the feminine is missing within her. The feminine ideal - creative, expressive, intuitive, receptive, empathic, connected to matter and spirit, has somehow been lost. In falling in love with another woman, she is really seeking to connect with herself.

Looking at lesbianism developmentally, I would suggest that she is seeking to unite with the archetypal ‘good mother’.”

As Eller-Boyko explains, many lesbian women who seek change do not persist in therapy. For them, giving up the emotional connection of a lesbian relationship seems too threatening - much like a death. She notes:

“We can say to a teenage boy, ‘OK, you can get your emotional needs met but it doesn’t have to become sexual.’ A girl, on the other hand, may perceive that the therapist is asking her to give up a relationship upon which she feels deeply dependent and needy. She very likely feels as if she can’t live without her love interest or ‘significant other.’

A lesbian may say, ‘When I‘m involved sexually, it‘s the only time I feel I‘m loved and cared for.’ Particularly for the girl who has been sexually molested, same-sex behavior offers a sense of control in the relationship with the other person. Such girls view their lesbian sexuality as a way to gain mastery of a threatening situation. It is the only time they feel ‘safe’ with their sexuality.”
