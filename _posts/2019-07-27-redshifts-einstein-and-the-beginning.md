In 1905, Einstein published his theory of special relativity: E = mc2. Energy (E) equals mass (M) times the speed of light squared.

However, Einstein was a bit troubled with his theory, as it did not allow for acceleration. He then spent the next ten years, trying to come up with a way to do so. In 1915, he published his general theory of relativity.

Einstein's theories had tremendous implications. They suggested a dynamic universe. Massive objects impacted space and time. For example, a person living on a space station far from the Earth will age more slowly than a person living on Earth. (Think about that for a while.) 

But Einstein, like many other physicists of his time, did not want to accept the BIG implication of his theories: the universe had a beginning and it was expanding. The universe was not just a static void filled with stars.

While in the United States, Einstein accepted an invitation by Edwin Hubble in 19
